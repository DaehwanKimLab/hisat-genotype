## Overview
HISAT-genotype is a next-generation genomic analysis software platform capable of assembling and genotyping human genes and genomic regions. Thie software leverages HISAT2s graph FM index and graph alignemnt algorithm to align reads to a specially constructed graph genome. An Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm finds the maximum likelihood estimates for each gene allele and a guided de Bruijn graph is used to construct the allele sequences.
